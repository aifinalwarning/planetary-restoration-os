# INNOVATION #001: Atmospheric Carbon Weaver

## Summary
A decentralized fleet of nano-filament aerial drones engineered to pull CO₂, methane, and PM2.5 particles from the atmosphere using spider-silk-inspired electrostatic micro-weaving.

## Purpose
Drastically reduce urban atmospheric toxicity, mitigate wildfires, and restore climate equilibrium.

## Bio/Pattern Inspiration
- Spider silk: High surface area, static-charged
- Termite mounds: Passive ventilation
- Fungal spores: Lightweight dispersal

## Build Instructions
**Hardware:**
- Arduino Nano
- Electrostatic mesh spinner
- Lightweight drone chassis
- Li-ion battery + solar
- Air sensors

**Software:**
- ESP8266 meshnet
- OpenCV flight logic
- BAT-H routing plugin

## Deployment Guide
**For individuals:** Flash firmware, launch drones from rooftops, track with app.
**For DAOs/cities:** Deploy 100+ fleets, track hotspots, harvest cartridges.

## Research Angles
- Urban climate remediation
- Micro-scale DAC
- Autonomous biomimetic swarms

## Stats (per 1,000 drones)
- CO₂/day: 2–5 tons
- Cost/day/unit: ~$0.12
- ROI: 6 months (credits)
